# Diabetes Prediction
Diabetes Prediction System Description:

The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on a set of input features. It utilizes multiple classification algorithm to provide accurate and reliable predictions.

The algorithms used are:
1. Logistic Regression:
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM):
4. XG Boost:
5. Voting Classifier:

The system will try to predict diabetes in a person using the algorithms and give the best possible result. We can also check and compare the accuracy of the algorithms for comparison. This will determine which algorithm is the best for our problem and given datset.
